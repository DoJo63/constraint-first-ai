Constraint-first AI architecture: air-gapped operation, fail-safe degradation, uncertainty-aware intake, governance-bounded optimisation, human-authorised outputs only.
Constraint-First AI Architecture
Design challenge:
How would you architect an AI system that:
Operates fully air-gapped
Degrades safely under partial failure
Maintains uncertainty at intake
Correlates across multiple signal domains without overfitting
Cannot optimise beyond explicit governance limits
Remains permanently subordinate to human authorisation
Integrity over performance.
